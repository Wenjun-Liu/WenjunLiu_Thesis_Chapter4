<p>Read assignment to genes was performed using Ensembl release 101
which used the genome build GRCh38 for generation of gene models. When
assigning reads to genes, <code>featureCounts</code> was run setting the
following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libraries were assumed to be <em>unstranded</em></li>
<li>The <em>minimum percentage</em> of a read which needed to overlap an
exon before being counted was 90%</li>
<li>In addition to the minimum percentage, <em>a minimum of 35
bases</em> must also overlap an exon before a read is counted</li>
<li>The <em>minimum alignment quality score</em> for a read to be
counted was 1</li>
<li>Counting of multi-mapped reads was permitted using fractional
counts</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>The percentages of reads assigned to genes ranged between
<em>41%</em> and <em>68%</em></li>
<li>Of the total reads:
<ul>
<li>0% was unassigned due to multi-mapping</li>
<li>Between <em>5.5%</em> and <em>12.9%</em> were aligned but didn’t
overlap any known genes</li>
<li>Between <em>0.62%</em> and <em>1.15%</em> were unassigned as they
failed the proportion overlapping criteria</li>
<li>Between <em>2.9%</em> and <em>4.8%</em> were unassigned as they were
considered ambiguous</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Only Tumour samples</h2>
<p>Although the overall PCA plot on all samples did not show a strong
flow cell effect, it is confirmed by re-performing a PCA on only tumour
samples. Again, the PCA was performed on genes with at least one read in
more than half of the samples.</p>
<p>Sequencing across two different flow cells did not introduce obvious
techinical difference but the inter-patient difference is strong.</p>

https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/configuration.html. This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
